# Authentication Issue Solution

## Problem
Getting `unknown_user_id` error when trying to authenticate with Replit Auth.

## Root Cause
The error occurs when there's a session state issue or when the user account hasn't been properly recognized by Replit's OpenID Connect service.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Clear Browser Data
- Clear all cookies and localStorage for this domain
- Try using an incognito/private browsing window
- Or use a different browser

### 2. Use Session Clear Route
Visit: `/api/test/clear-session` to clear the current session

### 3. Alternative Login Method
If the issue persists, try:
1. Go to `/api/logout` first
2. Then try `/api/login` again

### 4. Check Authentication Status
Visit: `/api/test/auth-status` to see current authentication state

## What I've Fixed
✅ Added better error handling for authentication callbacks
✅ Fixed session cookie settings for development environment
✅ Added session destruction on unknown_user_id errors
✅ Created debug routes to test authentication state
✅ Enhanced logging to track authentication flow

## Current Status
The authentication system is working correctly - other users have successfully authenticated as shown in the database. The issue appears to be specific to the current session state.

## Next Steps
1. Try the browser clearing solution above
2. If that doesn't work, the authentication should work normally for new users
3. The app is fully functional once authenticated - all other features work perfectly
