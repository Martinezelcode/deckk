Installation
Installing GramJS is a straight forward process:

$ npm i telegram
If you want to use GramJS in a browser please check the advanced installation page.

Once you've installed GramJS, you'll need an API ID and an API hash (read more in Authorization). Get them from https://my.telegram.org/apps:

Afterward, you can use the following code to send a message to yourself.

JavaScriptTypeScript
const { TelegramClient } = require("telegram");
const { StringSession } = require("telegram/sessions");
const input = require("input"); // npm i input

const apiId = 123456;
const apiHash = "123456abcdfg";
const stringSession = new StringSession(""); // fill this later with the value from session.save()

(async () => {
  console.log("Loading interactive example...");
  const client = new TelegramClient(stringSession, apiId, apiHash, {
    connectionRetries: 5,
  });
  await client.start({
    phoneNumber: async () => await input.text("Please enter your number: "),
    password: async () => await input.text("Please enter your password: "),
    phoneCode: async () =>
      await input.text("Please enter the code you received: "),
    onError: (err) => console.log(err),
  });
  console.log("You should now be connected.");
  console.log(client.session.save()); // Save this string to avoid logging in again
  await client.sendMessage("me", { message: "Hello!" });
})();
Using session strings is the most reliable way to save your session for now.

Full API
GramJS is still in its early stages but it can access all API methods from telegram using the following

JavaScriptTypeScript
const { Api } = require("telegram/tl");

const result = await client.invoke(
  new Api.channels.CheckUsername({
    username: "testing",
  })
);
console.log("Result is ", result);
All methods and classes are accessible under Api. for a full list of them check out https://gram.js.org/
