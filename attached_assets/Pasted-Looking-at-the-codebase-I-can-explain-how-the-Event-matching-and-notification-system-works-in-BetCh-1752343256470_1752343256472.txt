Looking at the codebase, I can explain how the Event matching and notification system works in BetChat:

Event Matching System
The event system operates on prediction-based betting rather than direct user-to-user matching. Here's how it works:

1. Event Participation Flow
Users join events by placing bets on YES/NO predictions
When joining via /api/events/:id/join, users specify:
prediction: boolean (true for YES, false for NO)
amount: bet amount
The system updates the event pools (yesPool or noPool) accordingly
2. Pool-Based Matching
Instead of matching specific users against each other, the system uses pool-based betting:

All YES bets go into yesPool
All NO bets go into noPool
Users compete against the collective pool rather than individual opponents
Notification System
Based on the current implementation, here's how notifications work:

1. Current Notification Types
Looking at storage.ts, the system supports these notification types:

challenge: New challenge requests
friend: Friend requests
deposit: Successful deposits
achievement: Achievement unlocks
2. Event-Related Notifications (Currently Limited)
The current system has limited event notifications. The existing notification creation happens only for:

Friend requests
Challenge requests
Successful deposits
3. Missing Event Notifications
The system currently lacks these important event notifications:

Event join confirmations
Event start/live notifications
Event end notifications
Event postponement alerts
Opponent matching notifications
Real-Time Communication
The system uses WebSocket for real-time updates:

1. WebSocket Implementation
From routes.ts, the WebSocket server:

Broadcasts messages to all connected clients
Handles event-specific messaging via event_message type
Used primarily for chat messages in EventChatPage.tsx
2. Current Real-Time Features
Live chat in event rooms
Message broadcasting
Connection status indicators
Recommendations for Enhanced Matching & Notifications
To implement a complete event matching and notification system, you would need to add:

Enhanced Event Notifications:

Event participation confirmations
Event status changes (live, ended, postponed)
Pool updates and odds changes
Result announcements
Participant Matching Features:

Show other participants in the same event
Display betting distribution (YES vs NO percentages)
Real-time pool updates
WebSocket Event Types:

event_joined: When someone joins an event
event_started: When an event goes live
event_ended: When an event concludes
pool_updated: When bet amounts change
The current system provides a solid foundation with the notification infrastructure and WebSocket communication, but would benefit from expanding the event-specific notification types and real-time event updates.

wrong format. YES and NO event pool all come into one pool called Event Pool - users who pick YES get matched with another user that pickes NO (in the same event room) which means events is based on FCFS depending on the amiunt of users the creators allows into the group. Also, there are Provate events too that is stticltyl by Request. See this codes to undertand my explain and dont work yet - just read to understand.

Thank you for the clarification! Now I understand the Event matching system correctly. Let me break down the key differences from what I initially explained:

Corrected Event Matching System
1. User-to-User Matching (Not Pool-Based)
Users who pick YES get matched with users who pick NO
It's First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) matching within the event room
One unified Event Pool - not separate YES/NO pools
All wagers go into a single pool, and matched pairs compete against each other
2. Event Types
Public Events: Anyone can join (like current implementation)
Private Events: Strictly by request only (requires join request approval)
3. Participant Limits
Creator sets max participants (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or custom)
Even numbers ensure proper YES/NO pairing
FCFS basis until event is full
4. Enhanced Notification System Needed
Based on the provided code samples, I can see the system should support these event-related notifications:

Event Participation Notifications:
event_join_request_sent - When user requests to join private event
join_request_received - When event creator receives join request
event_join_request_accepted - When join request is approved
event_join_request_declined - When join request is declined
Event Matching Notifications:
event_match_found - When user gets matched with opponent
event_joined - When someone joins your event
event_started - When event becomes live
event_ended - When event concludes
event_result - When event results are announced
Event Status Notifications:
event_postponed - When event is delayed
event_cancelled - When event is cancelled
no_match_found - When event ends without finding a match
5. Key Features from Code Analysis:
Escrow System: join_event_with_escrow RPC function handles secure fund holding
Match Detection: matched_bets_view shows when users are paired
Private Event Flow: Join request → Approval → Participation
Prediction Tracking: Users can see opponent info and match status
The current BetChat implementation would need to be updated to support:

User-to-user matching instead of pool betting
Private event join request workflow
Enhanced notification types for all event states
FCFS matching logic with participant limits
Real-time match notifications via WebSocket
This is a much more sophisticated matching system than the simple pool-based betting currently implemented. Would you like me to help implement any of these specific features to align with this design?
