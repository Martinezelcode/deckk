Here’s how Events and Challenges interact with the wallet system, and how both users and the admin make money:

---

## 1. How Users Make Money (Events & Challenges + Wallet)

### A. Challenge Flow
1. Challenge Creation:  
   - User A (challenger) creates a challenge, specifying a stake/entry amount.
   - This amount is deducted from User A’s wallet and held in escrow.

2. Challenge Acceptance:  
   - User B (challenged) accepts the challenge.
   - The same amount is deducted from User B’s wallet and also held in escrow.

3. Event/Contest Participation:  
   - Both users participate in the event or contest (e.g., a game, prediction, or bet).

4. Result Determination:  
   - The winner is determined (automatically or manually).

5. Payout:  
   - The total pot (User A’s stake + User B’s stake) is calculated.
   - The platform fee (admin’s cut) is subtracted.
   - The winner receives the remaining amount, which is credited to their wallet.

---

### B. Event Flow
- Events may have entry fees or pools.
- Users pay to join; the entry fee is deducted from their wallet.
- At the end of the event, the prize pool (minus platform fees) is distributed to the winner(s).

---

## 2. How the Admin Makes Money

- Platform Fee:  
  - For every challenge or event, the admin/platform takes a percentage (e.g., 5%) of the total pot or entry fees as a fee.
  - This fee is deducted before winnings are paid out to users.
  - The admin’s earnings accumulate in a designated wallet or account.

---

## 3. Wallet System Integration

- All transactions (stakes, entry fees, winnings, refunds, and platform fees) are processed through the wallet system.
- Users can see their wallet balance update in real time after each transaction.
- The wallet ensures transparency and security for all financial operations.

## Summary Table

| Action                | User Wallet Effect         | Admin Wallet Effect      |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Create/Accept Challenge | Stake deducted (escrow)   | —                       |
| Win Challenge/Event   | Winnings credited         | —                       |
| Lose Challenge/Event  | Stake lost                | —                       |
| Platform Fee          | —                         | Fee credited            |

---

In short:  
- Users make money by winning challenges/events (winnings go to their wallet).
- The admin makes money by taking a fee from each challenge/event (fee goes to admin wallet).
- The wallet system tracks and processes all these transactions automatically.

Here’s a clear explanation of the Challenge system in your app:

---

### 1. What is a Challenge?
A Challenge is a direct request from one user to another, inviting them to compete, bet, or participate in a specific event or contest. It’s a core social and competitive feature of your platform.

---

### 2. How Challenges Work
- Initiation:  
  - A user (the challenger) sends a challenge to another user (the challenged).
  - This is typically done by selecting an event or bet and choosing a user to challenge.

- Database Structure:  
  - Challenges are stored in a challenges table.
  - Key fields include:
    - id: Unique identifier for the challenge.
    - challenger_id: The user who sends the challenge.
    - challenged_id: The user who receives the challenge.
    - status: The state of the challenge (pending, accepted, rejected, etc.).
    - Other fields may include event details, timestamps, and wagered amounts.

- Status Flow:  
  - When a challenge is sent, its status is set to pending.
  - The challenged user can then accept or reject the challenge.
  - Accepting may create or join an event, while rejecting ends the process.

---

### 3. Notifications
- Pending Challenges:  
  - Users are notified when they receive a new challenge (i.e., when a row is added to the challenges table with their user ID as challenged_id and status pending).
  - The notification badge in the header shows the count of such pending challenges.

- Real-Time Updates:  
  - The app may use Supabase real-time subscriptions to update the notification count instantly when new challenges are received or responded to.

---

### 4. User Actions
- Send Challenge:  
  - Initiated by the challenger, creates a new row in the challenges table.
- Respond to Challenge:  
  - The challenged user can accept (status becomes accepted) or reject (status becomes rejected).
- View Challenge:  
  - Users can view incoming and outgoing challenges, their statuses, and take action accordingly.

---

### 5. Integration with Events
- Accepting a challenge may automatically enroll both users in a specific event or bet, linking the challenge system with the broader event system of your app.

---

Summary:  
The Challenge system enables users to directly invite others to compete or participate in events, tracks the status of these invitations, and provides real-time notifications for pending requests. It’s a key driver of engagement and competition on your platform.
