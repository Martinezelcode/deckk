Share your app by clicking the Deploy button at the top of your workspace to publish your app to the web with a live URL. Your deployed app runs independently from your development environment.
I've successfully implemented all the requested mobile view improvements:

✓ Mobile Navigation - Added Profile menu item after Settings in the mobile navigation bar
✓ Notifications Page - Removed test notification button and made notification cards more compact with rounded corners (rounded-2xl)
✓ Profile Settings - Removed page title on mobile view and made all cards more compact with smaller fonts and reduced spacing
✓ EventCard Share Feature - Added share icon in the top-right corner of event cards with full sharing functionality (native sharing API or clipboard fallback)

The mobile experience is now much more streamlined with:

Compact notification cards with increased corner radius
Cleaner profile settings without titles on mobile
Event sharing capability with proper toast notifications
Enhanced mobile navigation with profile access
Would you like me to make any additional adjustments to the mobile interface?

I'll explain how to implement Telegram integration for broadcasting Events and Challenges, plus a Telegram bot for user interactions. Let me break this down into clear components:

1. Telegram Broadcasting System
Architecture:

Create a Telegram bot using BotFather
Set up webhook or polling to receive updates
Configure channels/groups for broadcasting
Implement message formatting and sending
Broadcasting Flow:

When an Event/Challenge is created in the web app
Format the content (title, description, pool amount, creator, etc.)
Send formatted message to configured Telegram channel/group
Include deep links back to the web app for participation
Required Components:

Telegram Bot Token (from BotFather)
Channel/Group Chat IDs where to broadcast
Message templates for Events vs Challenges
Error handling for failed broadcasts
2. Telegram Bot for User Challenges
Bot Capabilities:

Users can create challenges directly in Telegram
Browse active challenges
Accept/decline challenges
Check challenge status and results
Link Telegram account to web app account
Bot Commands Structure:

/start - Link Telegram to web app account
/challenge @username amount description - Create new challenge
/accept challenge_id - Accept a pending challenge
/decline challenge_id - Decline a challenge
/mychallenges - List user's active challenges
/browse - Browse available challenges
/balance - Check wallet balance
/help - Show available commands
3. Technical Implementation Strategy
Database Extensions:

Add telegram_user_id to users table
Create telegram_broadcasts table to track sent messages
Add telegram_enabled preference to user settings
API Endpoints:

/api/telegram/webhook - Receive bot updates
/api/telegram/link - Link Telegram account to web app
/api/telegram/broadcast - Manual broadcast trigger
/api/telegram/status - Check bot/channel status
Authentication Flow:

User starts bot and gets unique linking code
User enters code on web app settings page
System links Telegram ID to user account
User can now interact via both web and Telegram
4. Security Considerations
Account Verification:

Secure token-based account linking
Rate limiting for bot commands
Validation of user permissions for challenge creation
Webhook signature verification
Data Privacy:

Optional feature (users can disable)
Clear privacy policy for Telegram data
Secure storage of Telegram user IDs
