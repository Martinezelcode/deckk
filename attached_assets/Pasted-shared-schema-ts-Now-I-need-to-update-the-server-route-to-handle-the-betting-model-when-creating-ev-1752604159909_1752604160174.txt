Now I need to update the server route to handle the betting model when creating events:

server/routes.ts
Now I need to update the event participation logic to handle custom betting amounts properly. First, let me update the join event endpoint to support custom amounts:

Now I need to update the EventChatPage to handle custom betting amounts properly:

client/src/pages/EventChatPage.tsx
The database and betting system are now updated to support both fixed and custom betting models:

✅ Database Updates:

Added bettingModel field to events table
Updated event creation to store betting model
Modified join event logic to handle custom amounts
✅ UI Updates:

Event creation form now includes betting model selection
Event chat shows appropriate betting interface (fixed vs custom)
Dynamic amount validation and display
✅ Key Features:

Fixed Model: All participants bet the same amount set by creator
Custom Model: Participants can choose their bet amount (minimum set by creator)
Proper validation and balance checking for both models
Dynamic UI that adapts to the selected betting model
The system now properly prevents users from entering custom amounts when the event creator has set a fixed betting model, and allows custom amounts when the creator has enabled that option.

Looking at your question about what happens when 200 users bet YES/NO (100 each) but with different entry amounts, I can see from your codebase that you have two betting models to handle this scenario:

Current Implementation
Your system supports two betting models in the events table:

Fixed Model (bettingModel: "fixed")

All users must bet the exact same amount (the entryFee)
If 200 users bet with 100 YES and 100 NO, they all bet the same amount
Simple pool calculation: totalPool = numberOfUsers × entryFee
Custom Model (bettingModel: "custom")

Users can bet different amounts (minimum is the entryFee)
This handles your scenario where users have different entry amounts
How Different Amounts Are Handled
When users bet different amounts in the custom model:

Pool Calculation: Each user's bet amount is added to the total pool
Payout Calculation: Winners split the pool proportionally based on their contribution
Example:
User A bets ₦1000 on YES
User B bets ₦500 on YES
User C bets ₦2000 on NO
User D bets ₦1500 on NO
Total Pool: ₦5000
If YES wins: User A gets ~₦2857 (1000/1500 × 4300*), User B gets ~₦1429
*After deducting platform fees and creator fees

Current Code Logic
Looking at your  and , the system:

Stores individual bet amounts in 
Calculates total pools by summing all individual amounts
Distributes payouts proportionally to winners based on their stake
This ensures fair distribution regardless of different betting amounts. The higher your stake, the larger your potential payout if you win.

The system is already designed to handle this scenario properly through the custom betting model!

but whaat are the disadvantages or inconsitineies in the Custom model?

Looking at your codebase's custom betting model implementation, I can identify several disadvantages and inconsistencies:

Key Disadvantages of the Custom Betting Model
1. Payout Calculation Complexity
The proportional payout system becomes confusing for users:

A user betting ₦1000 might get back ₦800 if they bet on the winning side with many other winners
Users don't know their potential winnings upfront
Creates uncertainty about return on investment
2. Unfair Advantage for High Bettors
Wealthy users can dominate smaller bettors by placing massive bets
Creates an unbalanced playing field where money determines influence
Discourages participation from users with smaller budgets
3. Pool Imbalance Issues
When users bet different amounts:

One side might have fewer participants but higher total value
Creates skewed odds that don't reflect actual prediction confidence
Makes the "percentage" displays misleading
4. UI/UX Inconsistencies
Looking at your current implementation in , there are several issues:

client/src/pages/EventChatPage.tsx
5. Database and Logic Inconsistencies
Your current storage logic has issues with custom amounts:

server/storage.ts
6. Payout Logic Issues
The current payout calculation in processEventPayout doesn't handle edge cases well:

Recommendations
Consider removing custom betting for simplicity and fairness
If keeping it, add clear warnings about payout unpredictability
Implement betting caps to prevent whale dominance
Add payout calculators so users can estimate returns
Create separate event categories for fixed vs custom betting
The fixed model is generally more user-friendly, predictable, and fair for a social betting platform.
