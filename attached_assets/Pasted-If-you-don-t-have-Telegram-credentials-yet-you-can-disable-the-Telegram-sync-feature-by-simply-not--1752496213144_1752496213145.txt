If you don't have Telegram credentials yet, you can disable the Telegram sync feature by simply not setting the environment variables. The application will continue to work without Telegram integration.

The changes I made will:

Add proper validation for the session string
Provide better error messages
Prevent the application from crashing when Telegram sync is not properly configured
Allow the app to run without Telegram integration
Checkpoint made
Fix Telegram sync initialization with better error handling

A session hash (or session string) in the context of Telegram is an encrypted string that contains your authentication credentials for the Telegram API. It's like a secure token that proves you're logged in to your Telegram account without having to enter your phone number and verification code every time.

Think of it as a "remember me" token that lets your application connect to Telegram on your behalf.

The error you're seeing is because the  script is trying to use CommonJS require() syntax, but your project is configured as an ES module. Let me fix this:

scripts/telegram-auth.js
Convert to ES module syntax
Now you should be able to run the script successfully:

What the script will do:

Ask for your phone number (with country code, like +1234567890)
Ask for the verification code Telegram sends to your phone
If you have 2FA enabled, ask for your password
Generate a session string that you'll copy and paste into your Secrets as TELEGRAM_SESSION_STRING
Important: You'll also need to set up your Telegram API credentials first. Get them from https://my.telegram.org/apps and add them to your Secrets as:

TELEGRAM_API_ID - Your API ID (numbers only)
TELEGRAM_API_HASH - Your API hash (long string)
Once you have the session string, your app will be able to connect to Telegram and sync messages between your BetChat and your Telegram group!

Great! You have your Telegram API credentials. Now let's set these up in your Replit environment and run the authentication script to get your session string.

First, let's add your Telegram API credentials to the Secrets:

Secrets
Store sensitive information (like API keys) securely in your App
You'll need to add these secrets:

TELEGRAM_API_ID = 1597725
TELEGRAM_API_HASH = 10efde9852cf2801b2dca15579207f26
After you've added those secrets, let's also fix the authentication script to use ES module syntax:

scripts/telegram-auth.js
Convert to ES module syntax and fix import
Now let's also make sure the telegramAuth.ts file has the correct ES module syntax:

server/telegramAuth.ts
Remove CommonJS check and fix ES module
Once you've added the secrets, run the authentication script:

What will happen:

The script will ask for your phone number (include country code, e.g., +1234567890)
Telegram will send you a verification code - enter it when prompted
If you have 2FA enabled, it will ask for your password
You'll get a long session string - copy this entire string
Add the session string as a new secret: TELEGRAM_SESSION_STRING
Optional: You can also set TELEGRAM_GROUP_ID if you know the specific group ID you want to sync with, or TELEGRAM_GROUP_NAME to auto-find a group by name (defaults to "BetChat Official").

After getting the session string and adding it to secrets, your Telegram sync will be ready!

just now
I can see the issue - the  file still has the old require syntax even though your project is configured as an ES module. Let me fix this:

scripts/telegram-auth.js
Now the script should work properly. Try running it again:

Make sure you have your Telegram API credentials set up in your Secrets first:

TELEGRAM_API_ID = 1597725
TELEGRAM_API_HASH = 10efde9852cf2801b2dca15579207f26
The script will then guide you through the authentication process to get your session string.
